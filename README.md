# Dogmeat

A bunch of shell scripts to carry all your common packages around, each time you re-install your system. It's a little like [boxen](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/#our-boxen) from Github.

## usage
```
# bundle up your packages and sort them alphabetically
./carry.sh
# install the packages
./fetch.sh
```

## included packages
Read these files:
```
files=("atom-packages.txt" "npm-globals.txt" "packages.txt" "ppa.txt")
```
